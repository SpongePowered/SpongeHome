## Local Environment
For your local environment, you will need the following:

- [node.js](http://nodejs.org/download/)

In terminal, or the command line use the following:

```
npm install gulp --global
npm install
```

Now you are ready to use Gulp.

For just building the sass files use ```gulp build```.
For watching the sass files use ```gulp watch``` - This will keep building the sass files as you edit them.
