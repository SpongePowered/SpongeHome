                    <p>The <em>SpongePowered Team</em> is looking to partner with companies and/or
                        organizations to help us develop the Sponge Platform,
                        help developers transition to using our API,
                        and inform server operators about the benefits of using Sponge for their servers.</p>

                <h1>About SpongePowered</h1>
                <p>What is Sponge?
                    A new Minecraft server API, with matching implementations for Vanilla and Forge,
                    created by the community for the community.
                    Our vision is to make Minecraft modding as easy as possible, both for developers and server operators.</p>
                <br>
                <p>SpongePowered is a major project that receives input from developers and users across the entire Minecraft community.
                    We have over 30 Staff and Developers on our Team (see our complete staff list <a href="https://docs.spongepowered.org/en/about/staff.html">on our documentation</a>).
                    We collaborate closely with developers from other projects in the community, including Bukkit, Cauldron, Forge, and Spout, as well as Mojang itself.
                    Our amazing community involves and commits themselves to the project, whether through developing plugins, displaying their creativity, or by spreading the word.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Due to the scale of the Sponge Project,
                    we are looking to give additional organisations the ability to help support the development of both our Platform and Community
                    in a cooperative and constructive manner.
                </p>
